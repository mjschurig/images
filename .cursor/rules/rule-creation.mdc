# Rule Creation Guidelines

## Purpose
This meta-rule defines the standards and best practices for creating and maintaining rules in the .cursor/rules directory.

## Rule File Structure

1. **Naming Convention**
   - Use kebab-case for filenames
   - End with `.mdc` extension
   - Be descriptive and specific (e.g., `devcontainer-features.mdc`, `git-workflow.mdc`)

2. **Content Structure**
   ```markdown
   # Rule Title (Clear and Concise)

   ## Purpose
   - Clear statement of what this rule accomplishes
   - Why this rule exists

   ## Core Principles
   - Key principles in bullet points
   - Fundamental concepts to remember

   ## Implementation
   - Specific steps or guidelines
   - Examples when applicable
   - Code blocks when relevant

   ## Best Practices
   - Do's and Don'ts
   - Common pitfalls to avoid

   ## References
   - Sources of information
   - Related documentation
   ```

3. **Writing Style**
   - Use clear, direct language
   - Include examples for complex concepts
   - Use markdown formatting consistently
   - Keep rules atomic and focused

4. **Maintenance**
   - Update rules when new information emerges
   - Include last modified date
   - Document significant changes
   - Remove outdated rules

5. **Organization**
   - One concept per rule
   - Cross-reference related rules
   - Use consistent terminology
